# micro-bit-to-micro-bit-accelerometer-data-to-unity
This project is an extension of a uni collab project:
https://dmsp.digital.eca.ed.ac.uk/blog/multidimensionalobjects2018/

In the uni project, I was using mbed os online to script microbits so as to send accelerometer data wirelessly to another microbit which then forward the data to usb serial port that could be read by Pd(puredata) or Unity or Processing or whatever that can read the serial message line by line.

This project aims at expanding and providing a complete set of resources specifically for sound designers so that they can easily use microbits as midi controllers (via Pd as the "middle man") in their digital audio workstation such as ableton or logic pro. Or even use those motion data in Unity to do whatever they want, e.g. particles...sound visualization etc.
